# URDF Robot Description

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose and structure of URDF in robot modeling
- Create basic URDF files to describe robot geometry and kinematics

- Validate and troubleshoot URDF files

## Introduction

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is an XML-based format used in ROS to describe robot models, including their physical properties, kinematic structure, and visual appearance. URDF files define the robot's geometry, mass properties, joint connections, and other physical characteristics necessary for simulation and visualization. Understanding URDF is fundamental to robot modeling as it provides the blueprint that simulation environments and visualization tools use to represent and simulate the robot's behavior.

URDF serves as a standard format for robot description that is understood by multiple tools in the ROS ecosystem, including RViz for visualization, Gazebo for physics simulation, and MoveIt for motion planning. The format allows for hierarchical robot structures with parent-child relationships between links connected by joints, enabling the modeling of complex robots with multiple degrees of freedom. URDF can describe everything from simple wheeled robots to complex articulated manipulators with multiple chains and end-effectors.

## Main Theory

### 1. URDF Structure
URDF files are XML documents that contain a robot element with links and joints. Each link represents a rigid body with visual, collision, and inertial properties. Joints connect links and define their relative motion.

### 2. Links
Links are rigid bodies that form the robot's structure. Each link can have visual properties (for display), collision properties (for physics simulation), and inertial properties (for dynamics calculations).

### 3. Joints
Joints connect links and define the type of motion allowed between them. Joint types include fixed, revolute, continuous, prismatic, floating, and planar joints, each allowing different types of relative motion.

### 4. Visual Properties
Visual elements define how a link appears in visualization tools. This includes geometry (shape and size), material (color and texture), and origin (position and orientation relative to the link frame).

### 5. Collision Properties
Collision elements define the shape used for collision detection in physics simulation. These can be simplified compared to visual geometry for performance reasons.

### 6. Inertial Properties
Inertial elements define the mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia properties needed for dynamic simulation. These are crucial for realistic physics behavior.

URDF Robot Structure:

<robot>
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder radius="0.2" length="0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder radius="0.2" length="0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="1.0"/>
      <inertia ixx="0.1" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="0.1" iyz="0.0" izz="0.1"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>

  <joint name="base_to_wheel" type="continuous">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="wheel_link"/>
    <origin xyz="0.0 0.2 0.0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
  </joint>

  <link name="wheel_link">
    <!-- wheel link definition -->
  </link>
</robot>
```

## Examples

### Example: Simple Two-Link Robot Arm
```xml
<robot name="simple_arm">
  <!-- Base link -->
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.1 0.1 0.2"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="blue">
        <color rgba="0 0 1 1"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.1 0.1 0.2"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="0.5"/>
      <inertia ixx="0.01" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="0.01" iyz="0.0" izz="0.01"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>

  <!-- Upper arm link -->
  <link name="upper_arm">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder length="0.5" radius="0.02"/>
      </geometry>
      <material name="red">
        <color rgba="1 0 0 1"/>
      </material>
    </visual>
    <collision>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder length="0.5" radius="0.02"/>
      </geometry>
    </collision>
    <inertial>
      <mass value="0.3"/>
      <inertia ixx="0.01" ixy="0.0" ixz="0.0" iyy="0.01" iyz="0.0" izz="0.001"/>
    </inertial>
  </link>

  <!-- Joint connecting base to upper arm -->
  <joint name="shoulder_joint" type="revolute">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="upper_arm"/>
    <origin xyz="0.0 0.0 0.1" rpy="0.0 0.0 0.0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" effort="100" velocity="1"/>
  </joint>
</robot>
```

### Example: Using Xacro for Complex Models
Xacro is a macro language for XML that allows for more concise and reusable URDF definitions using variables, includes, and macros.

## Practical Notes

- Use consistent naming conventions for links and joints
- Validate URDF files using tools like check_urdf
- Keep visual and collision geometries as simple as possible for performance
- Use appropriate units (meters for distance, kilograms for mass)
- Define origins carefully with respect to the link's coordinate frame
- Use xacro for complex robots to reduce redundancy
- Test URDF files in RViz before using in simulation

## Summary

URDF is a fundamental tool for robot modeling in ROS, providing a standardized way to describe robot geometry, kinematics, and physical properties. By defining links and joints with appropriate visual, collision, and inertial properties, developers can create accurate robot models that work across multiple tools in the ROS ecosystem. Understanding URDF structure and best practices is essential for effective robot simulation and visualization.
