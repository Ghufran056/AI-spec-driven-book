# Launch Files & Parameters

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose and structure of launch files in ROS 2
- Create launch files to start multiple nodes with specific configurations
- Define and use parameters in ROS 2 nodes
- Organize complex robot systems using launch files
- Configure nodes through launch files and parameter files
- Use command-line arguments in launch files

## Introduction

Launch files in ROS 2 provide a convenient way to start multiple nodes with specific configurations simultaneously. Rather than manually starting each node with its required arguments and parameters, launch files allow you to define complex system configurations in a declarative manner. Parameters, on the other hand, provide a way to configure node behavior without recompiling code. Together, these mechanisms enable the deployment of complex robot systems with consistent, reproducible configurations.

The launch system in ROS 2 is more robust than its predecessor in ROS 1, offering better error handling, conditional launching, and integration with the modern ROS 2 architecture. Parameters can be set from various sources including launch files, command line, parameter files, and programmatically, providing flexibility in how nodes are configured for different environments and scenarios.

## Main Theory

### 1. Launch File Structure
Launch files are Python scripts that define how nodes should be launched. They use the launch package to define actions like starting nodes, setting parameters, and managing the lifecycle of the system.

### 2. Launch Descriptors
Launch descriptors define what should be launched including nodes, parameters, remappings, and other launch actions. These descriptors are processed by the launch system to start the specified components.

### 3. Parameter Definitions
Parameters allow nodes to be configured at runtime. They can be defined in the node code, launch files, or parameter YAML files, and provide a flexible way to change node behavior without recompilation.

### 4. Node Remapping
Launch files can remap node names, topic names, and service names, allowing for flexible configuration of communication patterns between nodes.

### 5. Conditional Launching
The launch system supports conditional launching based on command-line arguments, environment variables, or other conditions, enabling flexible deployment configurations.

### 6. Composition and Node Groups
Launch files can group related nodes and manage their lifecycle collectively, providing better organization and control over complex systems.

```
Launch File Structure:

[Launch File] → [Launch Service] → [Node Processes]
                    ↓
            [Parameter Server] ← [Parameter Files/YAML]
                    ↓
            [Topic/Service Connections]
```

## Examples

### Example: Simple Launch File
A launch file that starts a single node with specific parameters:
```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim',
            parameters=[{'background_r': 255, 'background_g': 0, 'background_b': 0}]
        )
    ])
```

### Example: Multiple Nodes Launch
A launch file starting multiple nodes with different configurations:
```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(package='demo_nodes_cpp', executable='talker', name='publisher'),
        Node(package='demo_nodes_cpp', executable='listener', name='subscriber'),
    ])
```

### Example: Parameter File Usage
A YAML file defining parameters for multiple nodes:
```yaml
turtlesim_node:
  ros__parameters:
    background_r: 255
    background_g: 0
    background_b: 0
    sim_time: true

teleop_turtle:
  ros__parameters:
    linear_axis: 1
    angular_axis: 0
    scale_angular: 2.0
    scale_linear: 2.0
```

## Practical Notes

- Use launch files to ensure consistent startup of your robot system
- Organize parameters in YAML files for easier maintenance and sharing
- Use command-line arguments in launch files to make them more flexible
- Group related nodes in launch files to simplify system management
- Use parameter declarations in nodes to validate and provide default values
- Test launch files in isolation before integrating them into complex systems
- Document parameter meanings and valid ranges in comments

## Summary

Launch files and parameters are essential tools for deploying and configuring ROS 2 systems. Launch files provide a declarative way to start multiple nodes with specific configurations, while parameters allow runtime configuration of node behavior. Together, they enable the deployment of complex robot systems with consistent, reproducible configurations that can be adapted to different environments and use cases. Understanding these concepts is crucial for developing professional-grade ROS 2 applications.
