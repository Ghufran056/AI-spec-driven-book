# Workspaces & Packages

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose of workspaces and packages in ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 workspaces for your projects
- Develop and organize packages with proper structure
- Understand the package manifest (package.xml) and CMakeLists.txt
- Build and source packages in your workspace
- Use colcon for building multiple packages efficiently

## Introduction

ROS 2 organizes code into packages and workspaces to provide a structured and modular development environment. A package is the fundamental unit of organization that contains nodes, libraries, and other resources. A workspace is a directory that contains one or more packages and their build artifacts. This hierarchical organization enables code reuse, sharing, and collaboration while keeping projects well-structured and manageable.

The workspace-package structure in ROS 2 allows developers to organize their code in a way that promotes reusability and maintainability. Each package has a clear purpose and interface, making it easy to develop, test, and deploy individual components. The workspace provides an environment where multiple packages can be built together and their dependencies managed effectively.

## Main Theory

### 1. Workspace Structure
A ROS 2 workspace typically contains a `src` directory where source code is placed, along with build, install, and log directories created during the build process. The workspace allows for isolation between different development projects and provides a clean environment for building and running ROS packages.

### 2. Package Organization
Packages in ROS 2 contain nodes, libraries, interfaces (messages, services, actions), configuration files, and launch files. Each package should have a single, well-defined purpose and provide a clear interface to other packages.

### 3. Package Manifest (package.xml)
The package.xml file contains metadata about the package including its name, version, description, authors, license, and dependencies. This file is essential for the build system to understand how to compile and install the package.

### 4. Build Configuration (CMakeLists.txt)
The CMakeLists.txt file contains instructions for building the package using CMake. It specifies what executables and libraries to build, what source files to use, and what dependencies to link against.

### 5. Package Naming Convention
Package names should be unique, descriptive, and follow lowercase with underscores convention. Names should reflect the package's purpose and avoid generic terms.

### 6. Dependency Management
Packages declare their dependencies in package.xml, which allows the build system to ensure all required packages are available before attempting to build.

```
Workspace Structure:

workspace_folder/
├── src/
│   ├── package1/
│   │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   │   ├── package.xml
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── include/
│   │   ├── launch/
│   │   └── test/
│   └── package2/
│       ├── setup.py
│       ├── package.xml
│       ├── ros2_package2/
│       │   ├── __init__.py
│       │   └── nodes/
│       └── test/
├── build/
├── install/
└── log/
```

## Examples

### Example: Creating a Workspace
```bash
# Create a new workspace directory
mkdir -p ~/my_robot_ws/src
cd ~/my_robot_ws
```

### Example: Package Structure
A typical ROS 2 package contains:
- `package.xml`: Package metadata and dependencies
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Build instructions for C++ packages
- `setup.py`: Build instructions for Python packages
- `src/`: Source code files
- `include/`: Header files for C++
- `launch/`: Launch files for starting nodes
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `test/`: Unit and integration tests

### Example: Package.xml Declaration
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<?xml-model href="http://download.ros.org/schema/package_format3.xsd" schematypens="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"?>
<package format="3">
  <name>my_robot_control</name>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
  <description>Control package for my robot</description>
  <maintainer email="developer@example.com">Developer Name</maintainer>
  <license>Apache License 2.0</license>

  <depend>rclcpp</depend>
  <depend>std_msgs</depend>
  <depend>geometry_msgs</depend>

  <export>
    <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
  </export>
</package>
```

## Practical Notes

- Always create packages in the `src` directory of your workspace
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the package's purpose
- Follow the single responsibility principle - each package should have one clear purpose
- Use version control (git) to track changes to your workspace
- Regularly run `colcon build` to rebuild your packages after making changes
- Source the workspace's setup file (`source install/setup.bash`) after building to use the packages
- Use `rosdep` to install system dependencies declared in package.xml

## Summary

Workspaces and packages form the fundamental organizational structure of ROS 2 development. Workspaces provide isolated environments for building and running collections of packages, while packages encapsulate functionality with clear interfaces and dependencies. Understanding this structure is essential for effective ROS 2 development, as it promotes code organization, reusability, and collaboration. The proper use of workspaces and packages enables developers to build complex robot systems from modular, well-organized components.
