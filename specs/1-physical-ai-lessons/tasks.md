# Tasks: Physical AI Lessons

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-physical-ai-lessons/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- All lesson files will be located in `ai-driven-book/docs/chapter1/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Content Infrastructure (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **User Stories (Phase 2+)**: All depend on Content Infrastructure completion.
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3).

### Within Each User Story

- Creating the lesson file MUST precede writing any content to it.
- Content sections can be written in parallel once the file exists.
- Content consistency checks should be the final task for each lesson.

### Parallel Opportunities

- After Phase 1, the lesson file creation for all user stories (T002, T010, T018, T026, T034) can be run in parallel.
- Within each user story, after the lesson file is created, content sections (Learning Objectives, Intro, Theory, Example, Diagram, Summary, Glossary, Quiz) can be written in parallel.
- Different user stories (lessons) can be worked on in parallel by different team members.

## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Phase 1: Content Infrastructure.
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (Lesson 1.1) → Test independently → Ready for review/preview.
3. Add User Story 2 (Lesson 1.2) → Test independently → Ready for review/preview.
4. Continue for remaining user stories (1.3, 1.4, 1.5).

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Phase 1 together.
2. Once Phase 1 is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Lesson 1.1)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Lesson 1.2)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Lesson 1.3)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Lesson 1.4)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Lesson 1.5)
3. Lessons complete and integrate independently.
