# Create Robotics Advanced Topics Spec

## Prompt

Create  Chapters 7–10, with each chapter containing ONE fully merged lesson.

----------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 7
7.1 Reinforcement Learning for Robotics (All topics merged)

CHAPTER 8
8.1 Humanoid Kinematics, Dynamics, Balance & Locomotion (Fully merged)

CHAPTER 9
9.1 Conversational, Multimodal & VLA Robotics (Fully merged)

CHAPTER 10
10.1 Hardware, Sensors & Full Capstone Pipeline (Fully Merged)

----------------------------------------------------------

For each chapter-lesson include:
- 5–7 learning goals
- 8–12 subtopics
- A single Docusaurus lesson file

## Response

I've created the specification for the robotics advanced topics feature (1-robotics-advanced-topics) with the following details:

### User Stories Created:
1. Advanced Robotics Curriculum Development (P1) - Comprehensive lessons for educators
2. Self-Paced Advanced Learning (P2) - For students/researchers studying advanced topics
3. Capstone Project Preparation (P3) - For students building complete robotics systems

### Requirements Defined:
- 7 functional requirements covering Docusaurus compatibility, learning goals, subtopics, and content structure
- Content guidelines aligned with project constitution
- Key entities identified (Chapter Lessons, Learning Goals, Subtopics)

### Success Criteria Established:
- 5 measurable outcomes for student comprehension and system functionality
- All criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable

### Additional Artifacts:
- Created specification quality checklist confirming all requirements met
- Specification follows proper template structure with all mandatory sections
- No implementation details included, focused on user value

The specification is ready for the planning phase (/sp.plan) and provides a solid foundation for creating the four advanced robotics chapters as requested.
